    <h2>Jekyll Now</h2>

<p>I thought I&#39;d start off by writing about something fresh in my mind: the technical aspects of this blog! I&#39;ve decided to use a static page blog using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted by Github. In addition, I&#39;m using a out-of-the-box solution called <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">jekyll-now</a>. I&#39;ve chosen Jekyll for a variety reasons, but the main ones are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jekyll is <strong>very customizable</strong>. Jekyll is simple to use, which makes it easy for me to build with it.</p></li>
<li><p>Jekyll is <strong>fast</strong>. The generated static sites should be served much quicker than dyanmic sites like Wordpress.</p></li>
<li><p>I have lots of <strong>ownership</strong>. I see the code for the entire solution, so I know or can learn how things happen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Easy Github integration</strong>. My personal website is hosted through Github Pages, so adding a Jekyll blog to it is super simple if I also host with Github.</p></li>
<li><p>Last but not least, I <strong>feel like a &#39;hacker&#39;</strong>. Rich text editors? Psh, I&#39;ll be learning Markdown.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Thoughts on the Current Layout</h2>

<p>So after following Barry Clark&#39;s great jekyll-now <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">tutorial</a>, I really liked what I saw. The layout is minimal, elegant, and beautiful. There is a main feed that shows you a list of blog posts with a sizeable snippet to allow readers to the first portions of the posts.</p>

<h2>Adding Tags</h2>

<p>One feature that I didn&#39;t see was tagging. I decided to follow Theby&#39;s jekyll-now <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/pull/205">branch</a>, which adds a tagging feature in. It takes tag indices from posts and generates corresponding pages (a page for each tag, a list of tags on each poss) for those tags. For example, for this post I added <code>tags: [code, github, jekyll, jekyll-now, tagging]</code> to generate these tags.</p>

<h2>Problems on Live Version</h2>

<p>Theby&#39;s code worked great for sites without a <code>base_url</code> (sites without a <code>base_url</code> are assumed to just be hosted at username.github.io.), but for my blog, I&#39;m hosting it at <code>http://txizzle.github.io/blog</code> because my blog is a separate project repository being pushed through Github&#39;s <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/">project pages</a>. I changed some of the tag-generation links in Thelby&#39;s branch:</p>

<p>I basically replaced all <code>&lt;a href=&quot;/tag/&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;</code> into <code>&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/tag/&quot;&gt;</code>. Not too much of a change! I&#39;m just changing some <code>href</code> links, a fairly semantic change. This change allowed my blog to work locally; clicking tag links works for every location tag links appear (on posts, on the main page, and on the tag feeds).</p>

<p><del>However, the tags have not worked when I&#39;ve pushed my blog online! If you try clicking the tags above this post, you&#39;ll get a 404 Error. Why is this happening? I&#39;m not certain. It may be that the tag generation code is not working, so the <code>tag_index</code> pages are just never generated. I don&#39;t know if this is the case, because the  <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code> html links still redirect to the URL that I expect. There&#39;s just nothing there. Anyways, I&#39;ve <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/pull/205">asked</a> Theby what&#39;s up, and will update with anything I find. Keep posted &#39;til next time! This blog will look great(er) in no time.</del></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: It turns out the issue is that Github does not run Ruby plugins (how I&#39;m generating the tags) when you push to Github Pages! Charlie Park had a great <a href="http://charliepark.org/jekyll-with-plugins/">article</a> on how to work around this. Essentially, I generate the site locally, and push the generated files directly onto Github (as opposed to having Github both generate and serve the files). Cool! Tags work now. I&#39;ll make them more aesthetically pleasing when I customize this blog more.</p>
