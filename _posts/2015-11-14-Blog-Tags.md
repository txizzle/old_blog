#Introduction
I thought I'd start off by writing about something fresh in my mind: the technical aspects of this blog! I've decided to use a static page blog using [Jekyll] and hosted by Github. In addition, I'm using a out-of-the-box solution called [jekyll-now]. I've chosen Jekyll for a variety reasons, but the main ones are:
  - Jekyll is **very customizable**. Jekyll is simple to use, which makes it easy for me to build with it.
  - Jekyll is **fast**. The generated static sites should be served much quicker than dyanmic sites like Wordpress.
  - I have lots of **ownership**. I see the code for the entire solution, so I know or can learn how things happen. 
  - **Easy Github integration**. My personal website is hosted through Github Pages, so adding a Jekyll blog to it is super simple if I also host with Github. 
  - Last but not least, I **feel like a 'hacker'**. Rich text editors? Psh, I'll be learning Markdown.
