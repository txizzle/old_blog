    <h2>The Hunt</h2>

<p>Fall Semester draws to a close, and the end of the Finals Season also marks the end of Recruiting Season for many. This year, like many third-year students, I&#39;ve looked exhaustively for &quot;the one&quot; internship that&#39;s supposed to crown your junior year or even your college experience in general. 15 interviews from </p>

<h2>The Numbers</h2>

<h2>Why Software Engineering?</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve heard numerous EECS students at Cal note that UC Berkeley EECS culture is very heavily biased towards feeding into Silicon Valley Software Engineering (compared to Stanford or MIT). I&#39;m not sure of the atmosphere at other universities, but I&#39;ve definitely felt the pressure from what feels like a vast majority of EECS students eagerly following the &quot;script&quot;: mid-size or small companies Freshman and Sophomore year, a large big-name company Junior year, with the sole goal of working as a Software Engineer immediately after graudation. Many students take almost identical courses without venturing far off the beaten path. We&#39;ll all find particular areas we&#39;re interested in, but Software Engineering is always a very safe default. But that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing - the boatloads of cash, great perks, and a developer-centric culture are amenities unheard of in many other career paths. I&#39;m not not enthused that most students choose this path, and I wish that </p>
