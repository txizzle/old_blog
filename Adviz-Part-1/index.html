If you asked 10 people what the word &quot;startup&quot; means, you&#39;d probably get just as many different definitions. To many college students, it could mean &quot;an extensive tech project that I&#39;ve spent very significant time on and can see being something more&quot;. And isn&#39;t that really the same thing as a pre-funding startup?

    <h1>Wait Ted, what? <em>Your</em> startup?</h1>

<p>If you asked 10 people what the word &quot;startup&quot; means, you&#39;d probably get just as many different definitions. To many college students, it could mean &quot;an extensive tech project that I&#39;ve spent very significant time on and can see being something more&quot;. And isn&#39;t that really the same thing as a pre-funding startup? </p>

<p>So when people ask me what I&#39;ve been up to, instead of responding with a confusing mouthful about a class project idea that evolved, I just reply with &quot;working on my startup&quot;. I guess I&#39;m a cool kid now!</p>

<h1>Meet Adviz!</h1>

<p>These last few months, I&#39;ve spent a significant amount of time working on a side project called <strong>Adviz</strong>. </p>

<p>Currently, apps such as Google Maps or Waze can direct us the fastest route or shortest route, but not the safest route. Recently, a woman in Brazil using Waze was actually directed to the wrong address and <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/05/americas/brazil-wrong-directions-death/">killed</a>. In a nutshell, Adviz seeks to add <em>an intelligent security layer to your daily navigation</em>. </p>

<p>This idea stemmed out of a course I took last semester: IEOR185, Building Smart Cities Leveraging Open Innovation. As part of the course, I developed a technical solution (Adviz) with a feasible business model. This solution centered around making Visakhapatnam (one of the <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-US-India-teams-to-draft-plan-for-3-smart-cities/articleshow/46036760.cms">three smart cities</a> under development by joint India-US teams) smart.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a crazy but rewarding journey that&#39;s taken me through countless pivots and pitches, all the way from Berkeley, CA to Visakhapatnam, India. In the next few blog entries, I&#39;ll write about some fun experiences and takeaways I&#39;ve learned on this journey. </p>

<h1>My Role</h1>

<p>As this was my first interdisciplinary project-based class, I wasn&#39;t sure how our team structure would fall into place. From early on, however, it became clear that our team was composed of a many different experience levels and interests. </p>

<p>Over the course of a few weeks, I gradually grew into the role of a Product Manager / Lead Engineer, and was able to leverage many of my previous experience in consulting and software development. From early on, it was clear that our team was composed of a many different experience levels, interests, and motivation; this has definitely been a huge challenge, but I believe I&#39;ve grown all the more for it. It&#39;s been a very enlightening experience being in a position of leadership while having no direct authority. </p>

<h1>What I&#39;ll Write About</h1>

<p>So much stuff has happened on this hectic journey that it&#39;s hard for me to cram all of it into a single post. I&#39;m going to split up my reflections into four parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Part 1: Overview [This Entry]</li>
<li>Part 2: India: Nation in Flux</li>
<li>Part 3: adViz: The Tech</li>
<li>Part 4: adViz: Everything Else</li>
</ul>

<h1>See you next installment!</h1>

<p>I&#39;m currently in Hyderabad, India, waiting for my flight to Hong Kong, where I&#39;ll be spending 3 days. Look for an upcoming reflection on Hong Kong, which I&#39;m confident will be as different from India as India was from California. Until next time!</p>
