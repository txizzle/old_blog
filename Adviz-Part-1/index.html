If you asked 10 people what the word &quot;startup&quot; means, you&#39;d probably get just as many different definitions. To many college students, it could mean &quot;an extensive tech project that I&#39;ve spent very significant time on and can see being something more&quot;. And isn&#39;t that really the same thing as a pre-funding startup?

    <h1>Wait Ted, what? <em>Your</em> startup?</h1>

<p>If you asked 10 people what the word &quot;startup&quot; means, you&#39;d probably get just as many different definitions. To many college students, it could mean &quot;an extensive tech project that I&#39;ve spent very significant time on and can see being something more&quot;. And isn&#39;t that really the same thing as a pre-funding startup? </p>

<p>So when people ask me what I&#39;ve been up to, instead of responding with a confusing mouthful, I just reply &quot;working on my startup&quot;. I guess I&#39;m a cool kid now!</p>

<h1>Meet Adviz!</h1>

<p>These last few months, I&#39;ve spent a significant amount of time working on a side project called <strong>adViz</strong>. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been a crazy but rewarding journey that&#39;s taken me through countless pivots and pitches, all the way from Berkeley, CA to Visakhapatnam, India. In the next few blog entries, I&#39;ll write about some fun experiences and takeaways I&#39;ve learned on this journey. </p>

<p>As part an entrepeneurship/project course </p>
