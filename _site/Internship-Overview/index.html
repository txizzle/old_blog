This year, like many third-year students, I&#39;ve looked exhaustively for &quot;the one&quot; internship that&#39;s supposed to crown your junior year or even your college experience in general. It&#39;s been an arduous grind, but 21 interviews later, I&#39;ve signed with Amazon to spend my 2016 Summer as a Software Development Engineer Intern. I&#39;ve learned so much in this process, and I think some of my takeaways will be useful for others.

    <h2>The Hunt</h2>

<p>This year, like many third-year students, I&#39;ve looked exhaustively for &quot;the one&quot; internship that&#39;s supposed to crown your junior year or even your college experience in general. It&#39;s been an arduous grind, but 21 interviews later, I&#39;ve signed with Amazon to spend my 2016 Summer as a Software Development Engineer Intern. I&#39;ve learned so much in this process, and I think some of my takeaways will be useful for others. </p>

<h2>The Numbers</h2>

<p>Over the course of 83 days, I participated in 21 interviews. </p>

<ul>
<li>Product Management Internships:

<ul>
<li>Workday*: 3 phone screens. <strong>Received offer.</strong> </li>
<li>Google: 1 phone screen, 2 onsite.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Software Engineering Internships:

<ul>
<li>PDT Partners: 3 on campus, 1 phone screen. </li>
<li>Ebay: 1 coding screen.</li>
<li>Google: 3 phone screens. <strong>Host matching</strong>. Declined host matching interview.</li>
<li>Bloomberg: 1 phone screen.</li>
<li>Tableau*: 3 phone screens. <strong>Received offer</strong>. </li>
<li>Salesforce: 1 phone screen. Declined onsite.</li>
<li>Amazon*: 2 on campus. <strong>Received offer</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I was rejected after the resume screen for 5 companies.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dropbox*</li>
<li>Uber</li>
<li>Lyft</li>
<li>Palantir</li>
<li>Two Sigma</li>
</ul>

<p>*I had referrals for these companies.</p>

<h2>The Trends</h2>

<p><em>Referrals really work</em>.<br>
For the 4 companies I had referalls for, I received 3 offers.  Coincidence? I think not! Dropbox was definitely an outlier, but more on that shortly.</p>

<p><em>Honesty helps you</em>.<br>
In 3 different interviews, I was asked questions I had seen before. Instead of pretending to initially struggle and then miraculously solve the question, I opted to just say that I had seen the question before and then offer a brief analysis of the correct solution. I found that strangely enough, the reception to my candor was not just friendly, but actually <em>bonding</em>. I know that&#39;s a strange word to use, but I can&#39;t think of a better word to describe the exchange: the interviewers shrugs, commends you for your honesty, and maybe jokes about the difficulty in selecting good, unique interview questions. Talk about a confidence boost!</p>

<h2>The Takeaways</h2>

<p>In most of my interviews, I immediately asked for feedback in the form of a fairly leading question: &quot;Is there anything that I&#39;ve said today that&#39;s given you cause for concern or that I can clarify?&quot;  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not convinced that this is a good strategy to use, as I&#39;ve had mixed results. Some responses have been generic and actually noticebly negatively altered the closing tone of the conversation, but some responses have been useful. I&#39;ll paraphrase some of the good stuff and add my own insight. In addition, I was able to speak with a Dropbox engineer after my rejection from the resume screen; some of his feedback may be of interest to you as well.</p>

<p>For PM:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Separate opinion and fact. Be very clear on what you are hypothesizing or pitching, because bullshit without facts to back it up is just... bullshit. </li>
<li>Balance your tech self and analytical self with the user. Don&#39;t tunnel vision into market sizing and fancy sounding trends! You can <em>never</em> focus too hard on the end user.</li>
</ul>

<p>For SE:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resume-wise, many top tier companies are looking for:

<ul>
<li>A &quot;strong internship&quot; at another top tier company (Facebook, Google, etc.)</li>
<li>A significant project, which means many many Github stars or thousands of users</li>
<li>Stellar performance in the hardest CS classes your university offers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Figure out what type interviewing-style your interview likes. If they want to lead and tell you exactly which steps you should do (Make a class and explain it to me. Now make a signature... etc.), let them lead. If they let you do your own thing, be proactive. </li>
<li>If you find yourself rambling or your interviewer&#39;s tone changes, regroup. Fail fast and cut your losses! When you spend 10 minutes of straight talking on a simple question and then your interviewer chastises you and provides a very simple solution, you&#39;ve probably lost that interview then and there. It&#39;s better to check in a few minutes into your monologue to make sure the house isn&#39;t on fire.</li>
<li>Think about optimal run times. If you have a &#39;dumb&#39; solution but the space and time complexities match the optimal ones, maybe your &#39;dumb&#39; solution isn&#39;t so dumb after all. Fit the solution to the scope of the problem!</li>
</ul>

<h2>tl;dr</h2>

<ul>
<li>Get referrals.</li>
<li>Be honest.</li>
<li>Draw a clear line between your BS and your knowledge.</li>
<li>Read your interviewer.</li>
<li>Fit the solution to the problem.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bonus: Why Software Engineering?</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve heard numerous EECS students at Cal note that UC Berkeley EECS culture is very heavily biased towards feeding into Silicon Valley Software Engineering (compared to Stanford or MIT). I&#39;m not sure of the atmosphere at other universities, but I&#39;ve definitely felt the pressure from what feels like a vast majority of EECS students eagerly following the &quot;script&quot; (mapped out beautifully in my friend&#39;s <a href="https://medium.com/@qrazhan/cs-internship-recruiting-guide-aebb68912808#.cwy231wr5">article</a>): mid-size or small companies Freshman and Sophomore year, a large big-name company Junior year, with the sole goal of working as a Software Engineer immediately after graudation. Many students take almost identical courses without venturing far off the beaten path. We&#39;ll all find particular areas we&#39;re interested in, but Software Engineering is always a very safe default. But that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing - the boatloads of cash, great perks, and a developer-centric culture are amenities unheard of in many other career paths. However, I&#39;m not enthused that most students choose this path, and I wish that there was a more diverse array of opportunites that are actively persued in larger volumes.</p>

<p>However, in the meantime, I do recognize the flexibility of Software Engineering. I&#39;m not sure at all that I want to be a Software Engineer full-time for an extended amount of time, but I believe the skills I&#39;ll learn as a Software Engineer are invaluable wherever I go. Do I feel mildly pidgeonholed into Software Engineering? Absolutely! Is this a bad thing? Maybe not. I want to be a Data Scientist, I want to found a startup, I want to be a PM... but the skills I&#39;ll learn this summer will help me regardless of where I&#39;m heading in the next few years. </p>

<h2>Thanks for reading!</h2>

<p>I hope you enjoyed learning about my experience this recruiting season - I know I enjoyed writing about it. Feel free to shoot me a message with your thoughts!</p>

<p>It&#39;s been an exhausting, exciting job-hunt, but I&#39;m glad to have learned so much about the process, the companies, and myself. I&#39;m excited to learn, create, and grow this summer at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Earth&#39;s most customer-centric company</a>. </p>
