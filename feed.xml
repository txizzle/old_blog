        <title>My First Startup Journey, Part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;h1&gt;Wait Ted, what? &lt;em&gt;Your&lt;/em&gt; startup?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you asked 10 people what the word &amp;quot;startup&amp;quot; means, you&amp;#39;d probably get just as many different definitions. To many college students, it could mean &amp;quot;an extensive tech project that I&amp;#39;ve spent very significant time on and can see being something more&amp;quot;. And isn&amp;#39;t that really the same thing as a pre-funding startup? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when people ask me what I&amp;#39;ve been up to, instead of responding with a confusing mouthful about a class project idea that evolved, I just reply with &amp;quot;working on my startup&amp;quot;. I guess I&amp;#39;m a cool kid now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Meet Adviz!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These last few months, I&amp;#39;ve spent a significant amount of time working on a side project called &lt;strong&gt;Adviz&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, apps such as Google Maps or Waze can direct us the fastest route or shortest route, but not the safest route. Recently, a woman in Brazil using Waze was actually directed to the wrong address and &lt;a href=&quot;http://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/05/americas/brazil-wrong-directions-death/&quot;&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt;. In a nutshell, Adviz seeks to add &lt;em&gt;an intelligent security layer to your daily navigation&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea stemmed out of a course I took last semester: IEOR185, Building Smart Cities Leveraging Open Innovation. As part of the course, I developed a technical solution (Adviz) with a feasible business model. This solution centered around making Visakhapatnam (one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-US-India-teams-to-draft-plan-for-3-smart-cities/articleshow/46036760.cms&quot;&gt;three smart cities&lt;/a&gt; under development by joint India-US teams) smart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a crazy but rewarding journey that&amp;#39;s taken me through countless pivots and pitches, all the way from Berkeley, CA to Visakhapatnam, India. In the next few blog entries, I&amp;#39;ll write about some fun experiences and takeaways I&amp;#39;ve learned on this journey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My Role&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this was my first interdisciplinary project-based class, I wasn&amp;#39;t sure how our team structure would fall into place. From early on, however, it became clear that our team was composed of a many different experience levels and interests. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a few weeks, I gradually grew into the role of a Product Manager / Lead Engineer, and was able to leverage many of my previous experience in consulting and software development. From early on, it was clear that our team was composed of a many different experience levels, interests, and motivation; this has definitely been a huge challenge, but I believe I&amp;#39;ve grown all the more for it. It&amp;#39;s been a very enlightening experience being in a position of leadership while having no direct authority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What I&amp;#39;ll Write About&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much stuff has happened on this hectic journey that it&amp;#39;s hard for me to cram all of it into a single post. I&amp;#39;m going to split up my reflections into four parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 1: Overview [This Entry]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 2: India: Nation in Flux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 3: adViz: The Tech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 4: adViz: Everything Else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;See you next installment!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently in Hyderabad, India, waiting for my flight to Hong Kong, where I&amp;#39;ll be spending 3 days. Look for an upcoming reflection on Hong Kong, which I&amp;#39;m confident will be as different from India as India was from California. Until next time!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The 2015 Internship Journey</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;The Hunt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, like many third-year students, I&amp;#39;ve looked exhaustively for &amp;quot;the one&amp;quot; internship that&amp;#39;s supposed to crown your junior year or even your college experience in general. It&amp;#39;s been an arduous grind, but 21 interviews later, I&amp;#39;ve signed with Amazon to spend my 2016 Summer as a Software Development Engineer Intern. I&amp;#39;ve learned so much in this process, and I think some of my takeaways will be useful for others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 83 days, I participated in 21 interviews. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product Management Internships:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workday*: 3 phone screens. &lt;strong&gt;Received offer.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google: 1 phone screen, 2 onsite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software Engineering Internships:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PDT Partners: 3 on campus, 1 phone screen. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ebay: 1 coding screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google: 3 phone screens. &lt;strong&gt;Host matching&lt;/strong&gt;. Declined host matching interview.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bloomberg: 1 phone screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tableau*: 3 phone screens. &lt;strong&gt;Received offer&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salesforce: 1 phone screen. Declined onsite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon*: 2 on campus. &lt;strong&gt;Received offer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was rejected after the resume screen for 5 companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropbox*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uber&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lyft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Palantir&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two Sigma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*I had referrals for these companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Trends&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Referrals really work&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
For the 4 companies I had referalls for, I received 3 offers.  Coincidence? I think not! Dropbox was definitely an outlier, but more on that shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honesty helps you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
In 3 different interviews, I was asked questions I had seen before. Instead of pretending to initially struggle and then miraculously solve the question, I opted to just say that I had seen the question before and then offer a brief analysis of the correct solution. I found that strangely enough, the reception to my candor was not just friendly, but actually &lt;em&gt;bonding&lt;/em&gt;. I know that&amp;#39;s a strange word to use, but I can&amp;#39;t think of a better word to describe the exchange: the interviewers shrugs, commends you for your honesty, and maybe jokes about the difficulty in selecting good, unique interview questions. Talk about a confidence boost!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most of my interviews, I immediately asked for feedback in the form of a fairly leading question: &amp;quot;Is there anything that I&amp;#39;ve said today that&amp;#39;s given you cause for concern or that I can clarify?&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not convinced that this is a good strategy to use, as I&amp;#39;ve had mixed results. Some responses have been generic and actually noticebly negatively altered the closing tone of the conversation, but some responses have been useful. I&amp;#39;ll paraphrase some of the good stuff and add my own insight. In addition, I was able to speak with a Dropbox engineer after my rejection from the resume screen; some of his feedback may be of interest to you as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For PM:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separate opinion and fact. Be very clear on what you are hypothesizing or pitching, because bullshit without facts to back it up is just... bullshit. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balance your tech self and analytical self with the user. Don&amp;#39;t tunnel vision into market sizing and fancy sounding trends! You can &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; focus too hard on the end user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For SE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resume-wise, many top tier companies are looking for:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &amp;quot;strong internship&amp;quot; at another top tier company (Facebook, Google, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A significant project, which means many many Github stars or thousands of users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stellar performance in the hardest CS classes your university offers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out what type interviewing-style your interview likes. If they want to lead and tell you exactly which steps you should do (Make a class and explain it to me. Now make a signature... etc.), let them lead. If they let you do your own thing, be proactive. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you find yourself rambling or your interviewer&amp;#39;s tone changes, regroup. Fail fast and cut your losses! When you spend 10 minutes of straight talking on a simple question and then your interviewer chastises you and provides a very simple solution, you&amp;#39;ve probably lost that interview then and there. It&amp;#39;s better to check in a few minutes into your monologue to make sure the house isn&amp;#39;t on fire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about optimal run times. If you have a &amp;#39;dumb&amp;#39; solution but the space and time complexities match the optimal ones, maybe your &amp;#39;dumb&amp;#39; solution isn&amp;#39;t so dumb after all. Fit the solution to the scope of the problem!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get referrals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be honest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw a clear line between your BS and your knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read your interviewer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fit the solution to the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bonus: Why Software Engineering?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard numerous EECS students at Cal note that UC Berkeley EECS culture is very heavily biased towards feeding into Silicon Valley Software Engineering (compared to Stanford or MIT). I&amp;#39;m not sure of the atmosphere at other universities, but I&amp;#39;ve definitely felt the pressure from what feels like a vast majority of EECS students eagerly following the &amp;quot;script&amp;quot; (mapped out beautifully in my friend&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@qrazhan/cs-internship-recruiting-guide-aebb68912808#.cwy231wr5&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;): mid-size or small companies Freshman and Sophomore year, a large big-name company Junior year, with the sole goal of working as a Software Engineer immediately after graudation. Many students take almost identical courses without venturing far off the beaten path. We&amp;#39;ll all find particular areas we&amp;#39;re interested in, but Software Engineering is always a very safe default. But that&amp;#39;s not necessarily a bad thing - the boatloads of cash, great perks, and a developer-centric culture are amenities unheard of in many other career paths. However, I&amp;#39;m not enthused that most students choose this path, and I wish that there was a more diverse array of opportunites that are actively persued in larger volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the meantime, I do recognize the flexibility of Software Engineering. I&amp;#39;m not sure at all that I want to be a Software Engineer full-time for an extended amount of time, but I believe the skills I&amp;#39;ll learn as a Software Engineer are invaluable wherever I go. Do I feel mildly pidgeonholed into Software Engineering? Absolutely! Is this a bad thing? Maybe not. I want to be a Data Scientist, I want to found a startup, I want to be a PM... but the skills I&amp;#39;ll learn this summer will help me regardless of where I&amp;#39;m heading in the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed learning about my experience this recruiting season - I know I enjoyed writing about it. Feel free to shoot me a message with your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been an exhausting, exciting job-hunt, but I&amp;#39;m glad to have learned so much about the process, the companies, and myself. I&amp;#39;m excited to learn, create, and grow this summer at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;Earth&amp;#39;s most customer-centric company&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adding Tags to Jekyll Now</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Jekyll Now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;#39;d start off by writing about something fresh in my mind: the technical aspects of this blog! I&amp;#39;ve decided to use a static page blog using &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and hosted by Github. In addition, I&amp;#39;m using a out-of-the-box solution called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now&quot;&gt;jekyll-now&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;ve chosen Jekyll for a variety reasons, but the main ones are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is &lt;strong&gt;very customizable&lt;/strong&gt;. Jekyll is simple to use, which makes it easy for me to build with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt;. The generated static sites should be served much quicker than dyanmic sites like Wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have lots of &lt;strong&gt;ownership&lt;/strong&gt;. I see the code for the entire solution, so I know or can learn how things happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy Github integration&lt;/strong&gt;. My personal website is hosted through Github Pages, so adding a Jekyll blog to it is super simple if I also host with Github.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, I &lt;strong&gt;feel like a &amp;#39;hacker&amp;#39;&lt;/strong&gt;. Rich text editors? Psh, I&amp;#39;ll be learning Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts on the Current Layout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after following Barry Clark&amp;#39;s great jekyll-now &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, I really liked what I saw. The layout is minimal, elegant, and beautiful. There is a main feed that shows you a list of blog posts with a sizeable snippet to allow readers to the first portions of the posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Adding Tags&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One feature that I didn&amp;#39;t see was tagging. I decided to follow Theby&amp;#39;s jekyll-now &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/pull/205&quot;&gt;branch&lt;/a&gt;, which adds a tagging feature in. It takes tag indices from posts and generates corresponding pages (a page for each tag, a list of tags on each poss) for those tags. For example, for this post I added &lt;code&gt;tags: [code, github, jekyll, jekyll-now, tagging]&lt;/code&gt; to generate these tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Problems on Live Version&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theby&amp;#39;s code worked great for sites without a &lt;code&gt;base_url&lt;/code&gt; (sites without a &lt;code&gt;base_url&lt;/code&gt; are assumed to just be hosted at username.github.io.), but for my blog, I&amp;#39;m hosting it at &lt;code&gt;http://txizzle.github.io/blog&lt;/code&gt; because my blog is a separate project repository being pushed through Github&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/&quot;&gt;project pages&lt;/a&gt;. I changed some of the tag-generation links in Thelby&amp;#39;s branch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I basically replaced all &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/tag/&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/old_blog/tag/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Not too much of a change! I&amp;#39;m just changing some &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; links, a fairly semantic change. This change allowed my blog to work locally; clicking tag links works for every location tag links appear (on posts, on the main page, and on the tag feeds).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;However, the tags have not worked when I&amp;#39;ve pushed my blog online! If you try clicking the tags above this post, you&amp;#39;ll get a 404 Error. Why is this happening? I&amp;#39;m not certain. It may be that the tag generation code is not working, so the &lt;code&gt;tag_index&lt;/code&gt; pages are just never generated. I don&amp;#39;t know if this is the case, because the  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; html links still redirect to the URL that I expect. There&amp;#39;s just nothing there. Anyways, I&amp;#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/pull/205&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; Theby what&amp;#39;s up, and will update with anything I find. Keep posted &amp;#39;til next time! This blog will look great(er) in no time.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: It turns out the issue is that Github does not run Ruby plugins (how I&amp;#39;m generating the tags) when you push to Github Pages! Charlie Park had a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://charliepark.org/jekyll-with-plugins/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on how to work around this. Essentially, I generate the site locally, and push the generated files directly onto Github (as opposed to having Github both generate and serve the files). Cool! Tags work now. I&amp;#39;ll make them more aesthetically pleasing when I customize this blog more.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hello World</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello! I&amp;#39;ve decided to finally creating a blog after kicking around the idea
for a while. I&amp;#39;ve chosen to use Jekyll and host with Github; we&amp;#39;ll see how well
this works. I&amp;#39;m still learning Markdown and how to masterfully customize Jekyll,
 but am liking what I see so far! I&amp;#39;ll hopefully be posting on a semi-regular
 basis about everything from software development to random projects to new
 tidbits that I think will be interesting or useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking forward to sharing new things I learn!&lt;/p&gt;
